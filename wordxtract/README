Introduction
============

WordXtract is a program to pick up list of unique words
from any plain text or .srt file. Some words can be excluded
according to words in your dictionary

Compilation
===========

1. Compiling for Linux

    To compile this package for Linux you should have

        gtk+-2.0 >= 2.12.0
	libgtk2.0-dev

    The latest version of GTK+ can be found at http://ftp.gnome.org
    Executive summary:

	./configure
        make
        make install

2. Cross compiling on Linux for Windows systems

    To compile this program for Windows you should have cross 
    compiler installed on your system. You may be able to install
    pre-compiled packages (exact names can be different):
    
        mingw32
        mingw32-binutils
	mingw32-runtime

    or compile cross compiler, tools and install appropriate headers
    by youself. 
    Also you should have GTK+ headers, import libs and tools installed
    in the cross compiler directory. They can be found at gtk website:
    
	http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
    
    Then you will be able to compile the application by running    

	./configure.i586-mingw32msvc
	make

    NOTE: that this script was configured for the i586-mingw32msvc
    cross compiler which is supposed to be installed in
    /usr/i586-mingw32msvc directory. If it is not so for you, then
    you should edit this script for your system or maybe complitely
    rewrite it.
    Runtime libraries for the application can also be found at

	http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html
    
    And one more thing is required for  the program to be run properly:
    you should create gdk-pixbuf.loaders file in the PROG_DIR/etc/gtk-2.0
    directory. To accomplish this task you should copy
    
	gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.exe 
	libpixbufloader-png.dll
    
    binaries to the program folder from the gtk distribution for windows.
    Rough approximation of this explanation is:
    
	cp gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.exe PROG_DIR
	mkdir lib
	mkdir lib\gtk-2.0
	mkdir lib\gtk-2.0\2.10.0
	mkdir lib\gtk-2.0\2.10.0\loaders
	cp libpixbufloader-png.dll PROG_DIR\lib\gtk-2.0\2.10.0\loaders
	mkdir etc
	mkdir etc\gtk-2.0
	gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.exe > etc\gtk-2.0\gdk-pixbuf.loaders
    
    You can also dowload precompiled binaries from the wordxtract website
    and pick up all required binaries and configuration files there.
    
Running
=======

You can run application simply by typing 

    $wordxtract

Before you can add words to your dictionary and/or process
files you want. Also you can save processed text or/and 
list of words (words saving options can be found in 
Preferences manu item). After installation You also can
maintain basic dictionary which is in project root directory
by commands (assuming you are in project root dir)

    $mkdir ~/.wordxtract	#*
    $cp dict ~/.wordxtract/

* Note, that .wordxtract directory will be created
at first run so, you maybe don't need to create it

Enjoy!
