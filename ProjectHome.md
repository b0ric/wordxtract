**WordXtract** is a text and subtitle parser which shows list of unique words from any plain text or subtitle files.

Currently parser supports only English language but it allows to adjust number of settings which may be suitable for other languages. Some words can be excluded according to specified list of words in your dictionary. Words in this list can be single words or phrasal verbs like "back and forth" and etc. Also it allows you to save processed text and list of words.

Enjoy!

## Ideas ##

Few cool ideas to implement into the project:

  * Phrasal verbs processing control options (to not process "back, and forth" as phrasal)
    1. text
    1. line
    1. delimiters ('.', '!', '?', ';', ',')
  * A way to recognize plurals, gerunds and other grammatical constructions. This can be done in two ways:
    1. Hard-code english grammar into the application
    1. Implement simple scripting language to define target language grammar (harder, but cooler way)
  * Analyse text from clipboard
  * Additional subtitle formats support (e.g. .ass, .sub, etc.)
